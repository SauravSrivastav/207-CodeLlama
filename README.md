# Code Llama 🐫

Code Llama is a family of large language models for code providing state-of-the-art performance, infilling capabilities, support for large input contexts, and zero-shot instruction following for programming tasks. 

## Overview

- Built on top of [Llama 2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama) 🦙 and released under an open license to encourage responsible AI innovation. 🎉

- Available in 3 sizes:

| Model | Parameters | Details |  
|-|-|-|
| 7B | 7 billion | Can be served on 1 GPU, low latency ⚡ |
| 13B | 13 billion | Low latency ⚡ |
| 34B | 34 billion | Best performance for complex tasks 💪 |

- 3 main versions: 

| Model | Description |
|-|-|
| Code Llama | General code model 💻 | 
| Code Llama - Python | Specialized for Python 🐍 |
| Code Llama - Instruct | Fine-tuned for natural language instructions 🗣 |

- All models support input contexts up to 100,000 tokens. 🔁

- 7B and 13B models support infilling based on surrounding code context. 👷‍♀️

- Benchmark testing showed state-of-the-art results compared to other publicly available LLMs. 🥇

- Can generate code and natural language about code from prompts. 💬➡️📝

- Supports languages like Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, C#, PHP, Bash. ⚡️
